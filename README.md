# My Mauritius Hiking Adventures üó∫Ô∏è

This is a vanilla **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** prototype of an interactive map of Mauritius, designed to simulate a driving tour of hiking spots around the island.

The goal of this project was to get more comfortable with JavaScript without relying on frameworks or libraries. Everything was built from scratch, including animations, UI components, and state management.
